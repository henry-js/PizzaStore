# Deploy

.NET 8 must be installed to run this project
The solution uses [Nuke](https://nuke.build/) to automatically compile, test and publish the system.

The following command will restore package dependencies, compile all solution projects, execute the test projects and finally publish the application to the [publish directory](../publish) as well as create a [zip file](../packages/PizzaStore.zip) for easy sharing.

```pwsh
nuke Test Publish
```

I have integrated the nuke.Build project into my CI/CD pipeline using github actions, this enables the unit test projects to be automatically run on all commits, and before pull requests. If tests fail, the pipeline will not allow the code to be merged until whatever issues have been resolved.
