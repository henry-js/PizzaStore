# Testing

Unit testing is important for software engineering for a number of reasons:

1. Guard against bugs: Unit tests should verify that your code works as expected. By integrating into the development workflow and testing automatically, developers can catch bugs early (ByteHide, 2023)[^1].
2. Protection from regression: When adding new features the use of unit tests allows for programmers to ensure pre-existing features still function as expected (jpreese, 2022)[^2], helping to avoid an the entire class of regression defects.
3. Detect code smells: Using unit tests encourages developers to encapsulate code in a way that encourages adherence to the SOLID principles.

A unit test project has been built targeting the PizzaStore.Lib class library. These tests are designed to ensure the system adheres to the specificaction.

The use of unit tests themselves also help meet the non-functional requirements, specifically regarding maintainability. Testing the important parts of code allows engineers to ensure that new updates and modifications do not break existing code (Durga Prasad Acharya, 2022)[^3].
